Researching getting Windows 8 apps working on Windows 11! The plan is if I get everything working, make a build of Windows 11 that is debloated and looks exactly like 8.1!

Current Problem:
Most apps are crashing because they/their libraries can't find ordinal_1 in ntdll.dll, what is that function? I have no idea. That's the problem.

**This is only for testing on a VM! _DO NOT_ install this on your main OS! I'm not liable for any damage!**

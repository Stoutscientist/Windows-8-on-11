<h2 align="center">This is an attempt to get the Windows 8 explorer running on Windows 11!</h1>

## Installation
Go to releases then download and run the latest exe!

## How it works
This contains 3 files, the old explorer, and two dlls. The first one is `dwmapi.dll`, it handles all of the window management, the second is `uxtheme.dll`, it handles all the theming (app colors, etc.)

**This is only for testing on a VM! _DO NOT_ install this on your main OS! I'm not liable for any damage!**
